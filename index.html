                Public squares have long served as vital gathering spaces where people come together to participate in society, politics, commerce, and more. Many of these squares have a history of balancing formal functions–such as government meetings and public ceremonies– with informal, everyday uses like markets, protests, and recreation. Whether through their design or evolving use, public squares both shape and reflect the communities which they serve.

                The University of Chicago is no exception. At the geographic center of campus lie the Main Quadrangles (or simply “the Quad”), home to the oldest and most historic buildings at UChicago. Since the university’s founding, this space has served as a hub for academic exchange, ceremonies, discussions, activism, and more, for both students and faculty alike.

                        The quadrangles at the University of Chicago serve as both a physical and symbolic space, where architectural design intersects with constantly changing social, political, and traditional functions. By examining their original intent and design, their historical and contemporary uses, and the ways in which they’ve been brought to life by both formal events and spontaneous action, this project explores how the quadrangles function as UChicago’s dynamic public square. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project will look at the architectural design of the quadrangles from 1890 to 2025, exploring how their layout has encouraged social interaction and hosted official events. Not only will this project cover University-sanctioned events such as ceremonies and everyday recreational uses, it will also highlight moments of disruption–most notably the 2024 quad encampment in response to the Israel-Gaza war.
