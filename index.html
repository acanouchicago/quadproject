                Public squares are often the site of historical events and continuous interaction between members of a community or institution. At the University of Chicago, the place that best fulfills this mission is the Main Quadrangles, which form not only the physical center of campus but also the center of the many communities that make up the university as a whole.

                Here, different UChicago groups that do not otherwise interact elsewhere cross paths with each other: undergraduate students (the College), post-graduate students, faculty, administrators, and others. The quadrangles have been an emblematic feature of the university campus since its initial conception, having been imagined as the focal point by lead architect Henry Ives Cobb before a single cornerstone was even laid on campus in the 1890s.

                        current institutional identity.
